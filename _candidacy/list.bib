Except for gmake, all applications trigger scalability bottlenecks inside a recent Linux kernel. Using mostly standard parallel programming techniques-- this paper introduces one new technique, sloppy counters-- these bottlenecks can be removed from the kernel or avoided by changing the applications slightly. Modifying the kernel required in total 3002 lines of code changes. A speculative conclusion from this analysis is that there is no scalability reason to give up on traditional operating system organizations just yet.},

This scheme supports sharing and arbitration of multiple cores for a common set of accelerators, and it uses a hardware-based arbitration mechanism to provide feedback to cores to indicate the wait time before a particular resource becomes available. Second, we propose a light-weight interrupt system to reduce the {OS} overhead of handling interrupts which occur frequently in an accelerator-rich platform. Third, we propose architectural support that allows us to compose a larger virtual accelerator out of multiple smaller accelerators. We have also implemented a complete simulation tool-chain to verify our {ARC} architecture. Experimental results show significant performance (on average {51X)} and energy improvement (on average {17X)} compared to approaches using {OS-based} accelerator management.},

	abstract = {Modern chip multiprocessors ({CMPs)} are designed to exploit both instruction-level parallelism ({ILP)} within processors and thread-level parallelism ({TLP)} within and across processors. However, the number of processors and the granularity of each processor are fixed at design time. This paper evaluates a flexible architectural approach, called composable lightweight processors (or {CLPs)}, that allows simple, low-power cores to be aggregated together dynamically, forming larger, more powerful single-threaded processors without changing the application binary. We evaluate one such design with 32 cores called {TFlex}, which can be configured as 32 dual-issue processors, or as a single 64-wide issue processor, or as any point in between. Use of an explicit data graph execution ({EDGE)} {ISA} enables the system to be fully composable, with no monolithic structures spanning the cores. Simulation results show that {CLPs} achieve an average performance boost of 42\%, an average area-efficiency of 3.4x, and an average power-efficiency of 2x over a fixed architecture on a spectrum of single-threaded applications. Results also show that {CLPs} outperform a spectrum of fixed {CMP} architectures on a set of multitasking workloads.},

	abstract = {To extend the exponential performance scaling of future chip multiprocessors, improving energy efficiency has become a first-class priority. Single-chip heterogeneous computing has the potential to achieve greater energy efficiency by combining traditional processors with unconventional cores (U-cores) such as custom logic, {FPGAs}, or {GPGPUs.} Although U-cores are effective at increasing performance, their benefits can also diminish given the scarcity of projected bandwidth in the future. To understand the relative merits between different approaches in the face of technology constraints, this work builds on prior modeling of heterogeneous multicores to support U-cores. Unlike prior models that trade performance, power, and area using well-known relationships between simple and complex processors, our model must consider the less-obvious relationships between conventional processors and a diverse set of U-cores. Further, our model supports speculation of future designs from scaling trends predicted by the {ITRS} road map. The predictive power of our model depends upon U-core-specific parameters derived by measuring performance and power of tuned applications on today's state-of-the-art multicores, {GPUs}, {FPGAs}, and {ASICs.} Our results reinforce some current-day understandings of the potential and limitations of U-cores and also provides new insights on their relative merits.},

	abstract = {{DRAM} memory is a major resource shared among cores in a chip multiprocessor ({CMP)} system. Memory requests from different threads can interfere with each other. Existing memory access scheduling techniques try to optimize the overall data throughput obtained from the {DRAM} and thus do not take into account inter-thread interference. Therefore, different threads running together on the same chip can ex- perience extremely different memory system performance: one thread can experience a severe slowdown or starvation while another is un- fairly prioritized by the memory scheduler. This paper proposes a new memory access scheduler, called the Stall-Time Fair Memory scheduler ({STFM)}, that provides quality of service to different threads sharing the {DRAM} memory system. The goal of the proposed scheduler is to "equalize" the {DRAM-related} slowdown experienced by each thread due to interference from other threads, without hurting overall system performance. As such, {STFM} takes into account inherent memory characteristics of each thread and does not unfairly penalize threads that use the {DRAM} system without interfering with other threads. We show that {STFM} significantly reduces the unfairness in the {DRAM} system while also improving system throughput (i.e., weighted speedup of threads) on a wide variety of workloads and systems. For example, averaged over 32 different workloads running on an 8-core {CMP}, the ratio between the highest {DRAM-related} slowdown and the lowest {DRAM-related} slowdown reduces from {5.26X} to {1.4X}, while the average system throughput improves by 7.6\%. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare {STFM} to one new and three previously- proposed memory access scheduling algorithms, including network fair queueing. Our results show that {STFM} provides the best fairness, system throughput, and scalability.},
